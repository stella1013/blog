In Object-Oriented Programming one of the essential tenants is Abstraction.

The simple definition is you should simplify and reduce complexity.

In other words, you should show only what is relevant to the users or the interacting objects.

For example, I know what an alternator in a car does at a high-level view. The alternator charges the battery when the car engine is running. I don’t know how it works. I just know it works. This is Abstraction.

Abstraction has been a concept used by frameworks and employers alike and given developers the ability to ramp up fast and reduce the barrier to entry to develop feature-rich applications fast. I wouldn’t be here today without it.

I began learning JavaScript using popular frameworks such as jQuery. However, I’m now at the phase where I’m more interested in the inner workings of JavaScript. I’ve always been the type of person where figuring out the whys and hows of things make me tick. Just ask my parents. I believe the question ‘Why?’ was banned in our household.

So I'm creating a series of articles to deep dive into the depths of JavaScript. This series will uncover the shroud of abstraction around some of the more popular built-in methods of JavaScript.

If you find anything incorrect or something that could use further study, please leave a comment.

Alright, Let’s go!
